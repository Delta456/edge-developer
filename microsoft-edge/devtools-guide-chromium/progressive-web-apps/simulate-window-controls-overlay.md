# Simulate PWA Window Controls Overlay

In DevTools, in the **Application** tool, you can simulate the Window Controls Overlay feature that Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have, without having to install the PWA.  The **Application** tool has a **Window Controls Overlay** section under **Manifest**, to display a preview of how your Progressive Web App (PWA) handles window controls, without having to install the PWA and make the styling changes that are necessary to accommodate window controls:

Use the Window Controls Overlay to have control over the title bar area that's currently displayed in standalone display mode.  Window Controls Overlay (WCO) is a set of features that work together to provide just the essential controls needed for the app window.  This layout frees up more space for the web content layer.  WCO is available for installed desktop PWAs.

Use the **Window Controls Overlay** section to emulate window controls for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
