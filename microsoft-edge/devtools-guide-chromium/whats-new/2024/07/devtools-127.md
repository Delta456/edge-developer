# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 127)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]

## New Experiment: Use Copilot to explain HTML and CSS in the Elements tool

<!-- Subtitle: Enable the "Enable CSS Copilot" experiment to ask Copilot about elements and styles.-->

You can use Copilot in the Edge Sidebar to explain HTML elements and CSS styles to help you better understand a particular element in the Elements tool. When the experiment is enabled, you can ask Copilot about an element by clicking on the Copilot button next to it and asking follow-up questions.

To enable this experiment, select the `Enable CSS Copilot` checkbox under `Settings > Experiments`. This experiment is not available when the Sidebar is turned off.
