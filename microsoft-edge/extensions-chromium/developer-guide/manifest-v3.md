# Overview and timelines for migrating to Manifest V3

A _manifest file_ is the blueprint of an extension.  A manifest file for an extension includes information such as the version number of the extension, the title of the extension, and permissions needed to run the extension.  The manifest file follows the format specified by Manifest V2 or Manifest V3.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Overview of changes in Manifest V3

Migrating from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3 brings several structural changes to how extensions are handled by the browser.

In October 2020, Microsoft announced the [decision to embrace Manifest V3](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/10/14/extension-manifest-chromium-edge/) to help reduce fragmentation of the web for all developers and enhance privacy, security, and performance for end users.

Manifest V3 is an initiative of the [Chromium project](https://www.chromium.org/Home/).

An overview of the changes involved, as described in [Migrate to Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate):

* Background pages have been replaced by service workers.

* Network request modifications are now handled by the new `declarativeNetRequest` API.

* Remotely hosted code is no longer allowed.  An extension can only run JavaScript that's included within its own package.

* Support for Promises has been added to many methods.  Callbacks are still supported, as an alternative.

* Various minor feature improvements.

## Manifest timeline for the Chromium browser engine

Chromium has revised the timelines for ending support for Manifest V2.<!-- todo: add "in/for Chrome"? -->  See:

* [Manifest V2 support timeline](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline)
* [The phase-out timeline](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3#the_phase-out_timeline) in _Resuming the transition to Manifest V3_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Manifest timeline for Microsoft Edge and Partner Center
<!-- todo: condense this h2 section a lot -->

To help you plan the migration of your extension from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3, consider the following schedule for support for Manifest V2 and V3 in Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Partner Center.

The Microsoft Edge team will independently decide on MV3 migration timelines for Microsoft Edge Add-ons and share an update here.<!-- todo: revise wording in this h2 section? -->  We continue to analyze the concerns raised by extension developers and explore the optimal path for the Microsoft Edge Add-ons ecosystem.  Meanwhile, to plan the migration of your extension from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3, see [Manifest timeline for the Chromium browser engine](#manifest-timeline-for-the-chromium-browser-engine), above.


**The Microsoft Edge team is currently in the process of updating this MV3 migration timeline.**

| Timeframe | Microsoft Partner Center changes | Microsoft Edge changes |
|--- |--- |--- |
| July 2022 (already in effect) | Microsoft Partner Center will no longer accept new Manifest V2 extensions with visibility set as `Hidden` or `Public`. | No change. |
| TBD | Microsoft Partner Center will no longer accept updates to existing Manifest V2 extensions. Developers can submit updates for migrating a V2 extension to V3. | Microsoft Edge stops running Manifest V2 extensions. Enterprises can allow Manifest V2 extensions to run on Microsoft Edge, by using enterprise policies. |
| TBD | No change. | Manifest V2 extensions will no longer function in Microsoft Edge, even with the use of enterprise policies. |

<!-- todo: at TBDs, add "see below"?  or, replace right-hand cell content by the main point that's below? -->


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Timeline for ending support for Manifest V2-based Microsoft Edge extensions for enterprises

<!-- todo: orig draft wording, for reference:
about MV2 TimeLine for Enterprise:
 
We see the move to MV3 as a change in the positive direction to improve security, privacy and performance of extensions.
Our current strategy is to honour any new mv3 extensions from our partner ecosystem and any updates to existing mv2 extensions.
At the same time, we will continue updates for MV2 extensions for an extended period of time and will communicate once we plan deprecation of existing mv2 extensions.
For enterprises, Manifest V2 extensions will continue to be supported through Enterprise policies at least until the date in the Chromium Manifest V2 support timeline.
-->

The move to Manifest V3 improves the security, privacy, and performance of extensions.<!-- todo: delete sentence about MV3, b/c off-topic for this "MV2" section -->
Our current strategy for Microsoft Edge is to support new MV3-based extensions and support updates to existing MV2-based extensions from our partner ecosystem.<!-- todo: delete sentence b/c the mv3 point is off-topic for this "MV2" section, & the mv2 point is redundant w/ next, clearer sentence --><!-- todo: delete "from our partner ecosystem" b/c it's undefined & redundant or superfluous; not needed: can there exist any existing MV2-based extensions that are not from our partner ecosystem? -->
Microsoft Edge Extensions will continue to support updates for MV2-based extensions for an extended period of time, and we will communicate with extension developers when we plan the deprecation of existing MV2-based extensions.<!-- todo: move this sentence to be first -->
For enterprises, Manifest V2 extensions will continue to be supported through Enterprise policies at least until the date in the Chromium Manifest V2 support timeline.<!-- todo: revise phrase "at least ... timeline" -->

<!-- todo: delete almost all instances of "we", "our", "us", per https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/w/we -->
